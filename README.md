I just copy  for documentation.
I thing it is boring... becouse I need to knew what is be the method/fuction before I can write a test. 
I now have a hole modulen or all of them in the head/paper in my constitution becase I need. It is a nice try but not thanks... I shuld write ten times more code without this TDD method, but its a proces to do becouse of learning... the same as Clean Code....
